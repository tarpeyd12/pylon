#summary how to setup the code::blocks compiler for pylon compilation under windows.

= Introduction =

 # Install Code::Blocks in the usual way.
 # when that is finished, do no open pylon. open the C::B IDE then go to "Settings" -> "Global Variables ..."
 # under the "Current Set" press "New" and type in '`pylon`', without quotes, then press "Ok"

 # under the "Current Variable" press "New" and type in '`python`' without quotes, then press "Ok"
 # in the variable '`python`' the sections should be as follows:
   * *base* to "`C:\Python27`"
   * *include* to "`C:\Python27\include`"
   * *lib* to "`C:\Python27\lib`"
   * *lflags* to "`python27`"
   it should look like this:

 # under the "Current Variable" press "New" and type in '`base`' without quotes, then press "Ok"
 # in the variable '`base`' the sections should be as follows:
   * *base* to "`C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW`"
   * *include* to "`C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include`"
   * *lib* to "`C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib`"
   it should look like this:
